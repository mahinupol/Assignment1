                <p>As we all may have heard, Sylhet, Bangladesh is experiencing one of the worst floods in its history.
                    Over
                    a hundred thousand people over the 15 sub-districts in Sylhet are badly impacted. Flood situation is
                    getting even worse. This happened due to swelling of major rivers caused by continuous rain and rush
                    of
                    waters from the rivers.</p>
